## 1. Working Mode

The road-map consists of several steps which must be followed by the atendee. The training consists on a backend language part (Java) and a frontend one (Javascript but with some focus on Typescript). After each part the atendee will be evaluated by the mentor using a problem and/or a set of questions. An rought estimation is given based on the previous experiene of the atendee.

For faster reviews the atendee should use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
